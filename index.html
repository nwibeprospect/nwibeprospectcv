      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>As a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Benin, I am deeply passionate about integrating mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. Through my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in programming languages such as MATLAB and Machine Learning, which have allowed me to analyze complex data and develop algorithms that can solve real-world problems. Additionally, I have gained practical experience working with CNC lathe and milling machines, as well as pneumatics and hydraulics machines, through my coursework and research projects. I am also an expert in using SOLIDWORKS software, which has enabled me to design complex components and systems and develop prototypes of mechanical devices that I have conceptualized.</p>

      <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
      <h3>Mechatronics Engineering</h3>
      <p>University of Benin - Bachelor's degree (in view)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public Relations Officer, National Association of Mechanical Engineering Students, University of Benin Chapter.</li>
        <li>Member, Circle of Eleven Mechatronics Engineering Students, University of Benin Chapter.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Machine Learning for All</h3>
      <p>University of London</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I understood the basic of how modern machine learning technologies work</li>
        <li>I was able to explain and predict how data affects the results of machine learning</li>
        <li>I was able to use a nonâ€‘programming based platform train a machine learning module using a dataset</li>
        <li>I was able to form an informed opinion on the benefits and dangers of machine learning to society</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SOLIDWORKS CAD Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>SOLIDWORKS SWCAD1.0</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I was taught the fundamental aspects of the SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD software. I created sketches using lines, rectangles, arcs, and more. I used dimensions and relations to define the size and shape of the sketches. Next, I used the sketches to develop extruded bosses, cuts, revolves, and more into 3D solids, commonly called parts. I then combine the parts into assemblies and define the relationships between the parts using mates. To capture manufacturing information, I created 2D drawings of your 3D parts and assemblies. Finally, I learnt about the additional tools that allow you to do even more with your parts and assemblies. I learnt how to edit sketches and parts to make design changes and I learnt about configurations to create families of parts such as bolts of different lengths and diameters.</li>
      <h3>Introduction to Programming with MATLAB</h3>
      <p>University of Vanderbilt</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I learnt fundamental computer programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions and many others.</li>
        <li>I learnt about various data types and how to handle them in MATLAB. </li>
        <li>I learnt the powerful support MATLAb provides for working with matrices. </li>
        <li>I learnt about fle input/output. </li>
      </ul>
